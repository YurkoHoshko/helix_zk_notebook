[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HelixEditor/comments/144x6r3/escape_hatch_xd/)

## Required tools:

- helix - text editor
- zk - notes manager
- yq - YAML parser
- fzf - fuzzy finder


## Next steps:

- [ ] Prompt for notes that require title (e.g. if idea category is selected)
- [ ] Make a PR to ZK to have a command that will return all aliases / filters.
